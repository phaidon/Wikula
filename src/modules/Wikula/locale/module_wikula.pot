"===Categorization system===\n"
"This wiki is using a very flexible but simple categorizing system to keep "
"everything properly organized\n"
"\n"
"{{Category page=\"CategoryCategory\" col=\"3\" full=\"1\"}}\n"
"==Here's how it works:==\n"
"~- The master list of the categories is **\"\"CategoryCategory\"\"** which "
"will automatically list all known main categories, and should never be "
"edited. This list is easily accessed from the Wiki's top navigation bar. "
"(Categories).\n"
"~- Pages can belong to zero or more categories. Including a page in a "
"category is done by simply linking to the \"\"CategoryName\"\" on the page "
"(by convention at the very end of the page). To mention a category on a page "
"when the page does not belong to it, write its name in double double quote "
"in order to unwikify it. To link to a category on a page when the page does "
"not belong to it, link it using full URL like \"\"[[http://yoursite.com/"
"CategoryXy CategoryXy]]\"\".\n"
"~- The system allows to build hierarchies of categories by referring to the "
"parent category in the subcategory page. The parent category page will then "
"automatically include the subcategory page in its list.\n"
"~- A special kind of category is **\"\"CategoryUsers\"\"** to group the "
"userpages, so your Wiki homepage should include it at the end to be included "
"in the category-driven userlist.\n"
"~- New categories can be created (think very hard before doing this though, "
"you don't need too much of them) by creating a \"\"CategoryName\"\" page, "
"including \"\"{{Category}}\"\" in it and placing it in the **"
"\"\"CategoryCategory\"\"** category (for a main category or another parent "
"category in case you want to create a subcategory).\n"
"\n"
"{{sidenote type=\"warning\" title=\"Please\" text=\"help to keep this place "
"organized by including the relevant categories in new and existing pages!\" "
"width=\"100%\" side=\"none\"}}\n"
"**Notes:**\n"
"~- The above bold items were coded using double doublequote in order to "
"unwikify them to prevent this page from showing up in the mentioned "
"categories. This page only belongs in CategoryWiki (which can be safely "
"mentioned) after all !\n"
"~- In order to avoid accidental miscategorization you should unwikify all "
"camelcased non-related \"\"CategoryName\"\" on a page. This is a side-effect "
"of how the categorizing system works: it's based on a backlinking and is not "
"restricted to the footer convention.\n"
"~- Don't be put of by the name of this page (WikiCategory) which is a "
"logical name (it's about the Wiki and explains Category) but doesn't have "
"any special role in the Categorizing system.\n"
"~- To end with this is the **standard convention** to include the categories "
"(both the wiki code and the result):\n"
"%%==Categories==\n"
"CategoryWiki\n"
"\n"

"==Categories==\n"

"===13. Mindmaps===\n"
"\n"
"Wikka has native support for [[Wikka:FreeMind mindmaps]]. There are two "
"options for embedding a mindmap in a wiki page.\n"
"\n"
"**Option 1:** Upload a \"\"FreeMind\"\" file to a webserver, and then place "
"a link to it on a wikka page:\n"
"  ##\"\"http://yourdomain.com/freemind/freemind.mm\"\"##\n"
"No special formatting is necessary.\n"
"\n"
"**Option 2:** Paste the \"\"FreeMind\"\" data directly into a wikka page:\n"
"~- Open a \"\"FreeMind\"\" file with a text editor.\n"
"~- Select all, and copy the data.\n"
"~- Browse to your Wikka site and paste the Freemind data into a page. \n"
"\n"
"===14. Embedded HTML===\n"
"\n"
"You can easily paste HTML in a wiki page by wrapping it into two sets of "
"doublequotes. \n"
"\n"
"~##&quot;&quot;[html code]&quot;&quot;##\n"
"\n"
"<<\n"
"~##&quot;&quot;y = x<sup>n+1</sup>&quot;&quot;##\n"
"~\"\"y = x<sup>n+1</sup>\"\"\n"
"<<::c::\n"
"<<\n"
"~##&quot;&quot;<acronym title=\"Cascade Style Sheet\">CSS</acronym>&quot;"
"&quot;##\n"
"~\"\"<acronym title=\"Cascade Style Sheet\">CSS</acronym>\"\"\n"
"<<::c::By default, some HTML tags are removed by the \"\"SafeHTML\"\" parser "
"to protect against potentially dangerous code.  The list of tags that are "
"stripped can be found on the Wikka:SafeHTML page.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible to allow //all// HTML tags to be used, see Wikka:UsingHTML "
"for more information.\n"
